Sigma
=====

This is my first Python text game. It's a text-based RPG. Sort of like LoZ and Skyrim. You solve puzzles and fight monsters. 

For the puzzles I would recommend solving some of them using pen and paper. Some are math puzzles others are logical and practical reasoning.

Also, your chances of defeating a normal enemy and escaping will depend on the type of weapon your choose. If you choose a light weapon (1H-Sword) then you'll have a greater chance to escape but a less chance to kill. Vice versa with a heavy weapon (2H-Sword).
===============================================================

TO RUN THE FILE:

WINDOWS:
==========

1.) Double-click the Sigma.py file

2.) The game should start



MAC OSX:
==========

See if you can double-click the file open like in Windows, if not then follow steps below.

1.) Open Terminal
2.) Type 'python' (w/o) quotes in the terminal.
You should see '>>>'
3.) If you don't then go to the website and install it.
3b.) If you do have it, type 'exit()' in the terminal. It should return back to normal.
4.) When you have python, change directories to the folder with the .py file.
5.) Once you are in the folder with the .py file type the following in the terminal.
python Sigma.py
6.) The game should start

If you don't know how to change directories go find out.



LINUX:
========

If you're using the Master Race then I am assuming you know how to run .py files.
There are too many Linux distros for me to do instructions on. It's similar to OSX if you don't know.
