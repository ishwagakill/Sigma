Sigma
=====

This is my first Python text game. It's a text-based RPG. Sort of like LoZ and Skyrim. You solve puzzles and fight monsters. 

For the puzzles I would recommend solving some of them using pen and paper. Some are math puzzles others are logical and practical reasoning.
===============================================================

TO RUN THE FILE:

WINDOWS:
==========

1.) Go run Windows Powershell. You can search this on the start menu.
2.) When you have it, type 'python' (w/o quotes) in the terminal.
You should see  '>>>'
3.) If you don't then you don't have Python installed. Go to the website and install it.
3b.) If you do, then type 'exit()' in the terminal. It should return to normal.
4.) When you do have python, open up Powershell and change directories to the folder with the .py file.
5.) To do this type 'cd Some\_Folder' in the terminal (w/o quotes). Where Some_Folder is the folder you want.
EXAMPLE
Say the .py file is in C:\Users\John Smith\Documents\Sigma\

You would type:
cd Users
cd 'John Smith'        <---- (Quotes needed if there is a space in the folder/file name_
cd Documents
cd Sigma

6.) Once you are in the folder with the .py file type the following in the terminal.
python -W ignore Sigma.py

7.) The game should start



MAC OSX:
==========

1.) Open Terminal
2.) Type 'python' (w/o) quotes in the terminal.
You should see '>>>'
3.) If you don't then go to the website and install it.
3b.) If you do have it, type 'exit()' in the terminal. It should return back to normal.
4.) When you have python, change directories to the folder with the .py file.
5.) Once you are in the folder with the .py file type the following in the terminal.
python -W ignore Sigma.py

6.) The game should start

If you don't know how to change directories go find out. It is similar to Windows so just try to figure out by looking at those directions.



LINUX:
========

If you're using the Master Race then I am assuming you know how to run .py files.
There are too many Linux distros for me to do instructions on. It's similar to OSX if you don't know.
